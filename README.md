BPM Detector for Pebble

Simple BPM detector. Tap on the face or tap on the table with the hand the watch is on to get the beats per minute of your taps.

Currently only detects on the Z-axis, but can be easily modified to work on any other single access.  Can be more difficutly modified to combine all 3 axies.
